# Start-up-cases

## BigQuery

First things first, we have created our dataset "IMDB_finalproject" & tables (named: "output," "sentiments_df," and "total_nrj) configured with the project ID "IMDB Datasets - Final Project" and once authenticated, we gains the necessary credentials to interact with these services. we used a python script to import our database from BigQuery and stocked them in dataframes.
